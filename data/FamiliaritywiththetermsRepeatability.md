# Agreement with the ACM Repeatability Definition


### [Q8] Repeatability: "The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by the same team using the same measurement procedure, the same measuring system, under the same operating conditions, in the same location on multiple trials." - ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) definition for Repeatability.

#### Do you agree with ACM's definition of Repeatability?

- Answers: **Strongly; Agree Agree; Neither Agree nor Disagree; Disagree Strongly; Disagree**.

### [Q9] Briefly explain your answer to the previous question.

| P02  | Neither Agree nor Disagree | The definition is probably fine as it is but it is not relevant for software engineering since we never measure the same thing on the same data with the same measurement instrument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| P33  | Agree                      | It is possible to agree, considering it as a statement of an ideal condition, but replication of experiments can be used to take measurements in different contexts by different people. Furthermore, the context of this statement is repeatability. Considering experimentation, the objective of the lab package is to support the repeatability of experimental studies, not exactly as stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| P35  | Agree                      | Seems like a reasonable definition, though I might disagree with it in light of any particular taxonomy of terms (replication, repeatability, reproducible, etc.), depending on what terms we choose for what. In general, though, the exact term is less of a concern than a clear understanding of what types of outcomes we need to see over what types of contextual variation, and thus, the extent to which and how results generalize (vs. pivot based on specific contextual factors). And what methods we have for exploring and finally determining those factors and phenomena. So we really need to stop trying to get the next cool pub, and focus more on developing a process by which we work out the above, with specific methods for the various parts and tasks in that process. And let the research community crowd source the process around specific important topics. |

| P48  | Strongly Agree             | I agree with the definition that repeatability allows comparing results obtained in the same experiment considering the same conditions. Thus, we can have a family of empirical studies that increases the confidence of the results and adds more data, enabling more specific analyses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| P54  | Strongly Agree             | this should be observed when we do multiple runs to cater for non-detirministic or random behaviour. The experiment should be repeated with the same exact controled parameters.

| P93  | Neither Agree nor Disagree | In HOEs (Human oriented experiments) this idea of same team and same experimental setup seems to refer to a internal replication. Nevertheless, sometimes I believe that it is referred to repeat the analysis (With the same or other technique) instead to repeat the experiment. I don't really see clear this definition. For a better understanding of this definition, for me is useful the phrase "For computational experiments, this means that a researcher can reliably repeat her own computation" in de ACM                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| P98  | Agree                      | Operating conditions is a bit of a vague term, as software running may be influenced by numerous other factors (non-determinism, other software competing with resources, etc.) But, overall, it is a reasonable definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| P99  | Agree                      | This definition seems to be making assumptions about what is meant by measurement and precision that may not apply in all cases (e.g. studies that use machine learning)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
