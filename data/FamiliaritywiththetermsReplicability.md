# Familiarity with the terms - Replicability

#### [Q12] Replicability: "The measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials." - ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) definition for Replicability. Do you agree with ACM's definition of Replicability?

#### [Q13] Briefly explain your answer to the previous question.

| P8   | Strongly Agree             | this is the measuring system that is being varied. of course the problem is now that everything else has also changed and so replicability is not such a strong notion as it sounds. ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| P24  | Disagree                   | I think the definition of "the measurement" here is unclear. Perhaps we should define it better. What is the measurement in this case? a particular result?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| P31  | Neither Agree nor Disagree | There is a trap here from the perspective of experimentation ("different measuring system"). Replication presupposes the same measurement system, although there may be variation due to the increase of new measurements, maintaining the previous ones. Therefore, it doesn't need to be the same. There can be variation without being completely different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| P33  | Agree                      | Again, reasonable definition, but still misses the central problem of how to expose contextual variation in a way that it can be measured, both for artificial and real factors. Stability of results is not to be found strictly in figuring out how to control a study sufficient to get the same results under different protocols and by different researchers. That can be achieved to some extent without ever understanding many of the real-world contextual factors at play. There's a host of such factors that need to be uncovered and then studied in relation to the main effect. We need terminology and then process to help the community tackle that broader problem, and then we will be able to achieve stable results with respect to repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability.                                                                                                                    |

| P52  | Agree                      | I agree mostly, but the definiton of the "different measuring system" is rather vague in my opinion for SE research. In my opinion, a successful replication should be able to produce similar results (with an acceptable margin arising from the subject matter), with the same measures, but aplying the technique on a different set of data (but gathered in the same fasion as the oiriginal study), or using different method (or implementation) which measuring the same effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| P91  | Neither Agree nor Disagree | Classically in Empirical Software Engineeing, the term “replication” could be accompanied by external or internal adjective. An internal replication is carried out by the same experimenters (same team) and the external ones for other experimenters (different team). Other qualifying adjectives have been defined (such us closed replication, non-exact replication, incremental replication. Etc.) to highlighy whether the replication preserves the same experimental design, experimental material, empirical strategy (and so on) with respect to the original experiment. Nevertheless, according to ACM, replication is referred to the external replication in which changes are introduced in the experimental setup, but “experimental setup” is an expression that includes a wide number of elements. So the adjective should be specified. Note also that replicability and replication are different ideas. |
