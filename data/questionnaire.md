## Questionnaire

## A survey on Replication, Reproduction and Repetition

Welcome!

I am Ivanildo Monteiro de Azevedo, Ph.D. student at the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. This survey is part of the research conducted under the supervision of Professors Sergio Soares (CIn/UFPE) and Eudis Oliveira Teixeira (IFSertãoPE), and we greatly
appreciate your assistance in responding to it.

This survey explores the perception of Empirical Software Engineering experts concerning the so-called "Replication Crisis" and the acceptability of the definition of the terms Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability in the Software Engineering context.

This survey is objective in most, and its questions aim to get your responses. In other words, it does not have right or wrong
answers. The average time to complete the survey is between 20 and 30 minutes. The next 18 pages have one or two questions each and were designed this way because the next question page depends on your answer.

We would like you to answer the following questions in English or Brazilian Portuguese.
Data will be collected in a way that allows the anonymity of the respondent, not allowing their identification. We grant the privacy
of using the collected information following the Brazilian personal data protection law, General Personal Data Protection Law (LGPD), available at: [https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l12965.htm](https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l12965.htm)

In case of questions about the survey, you can contact us by email: ima2 at cin dot ufpe dot br, scbs at cin dot ufpe dot br, and
eudis dot oliveira at ifsertao-pe dot edu dot br.

Finally, thank you in advance for your collaboration and contribution to this research.

#### `Replication Crisis in Software Engineering`

18. "The Replication Crisis, characterized by continuous difficulty in replicating or reproducing scientific studies, reveals a severe methodological gap in research. Many scientific discoveries have proven difficult or even impossible to replicate, generating a crisis of confidence in the scientific community. This situation highlights the need for a more rigorous and transparent approach to conducting and documenting studies to guarantee the reliability and validity of the results obtained." [1]*
