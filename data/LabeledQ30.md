| P07  | The most important factor for me would be that program committees and editorial board would accept a paper submission with replicability. Most of the times, it is rejected by saying it is not new, not original, already done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | \- Support for replication publications.                                                                                                              |

| P42  | I think the more damaging problem is the pressure to publish a lot of paper, that reduces the quality of the papers. I think exiting the "how many articles did you publish?" paradigm to judge researchers to replace it by something like "what is your best published result?" would greatly contribute to a reduced need for pushing papers, thus improving the quality of what's being done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | \- Cultural change.                                                                                                                                   |

| P75  | Documentação detalhada e compartilhada de procedimentos comuns para 3R no âmbito de ESE seria um grande facilitador. Por exemplo, o projeto Empirical Standards e ferramentas associadas (https://www2.sigsoft.org/EmpiricalStandards/tools/) permitem, ao menos, verificar se cumprimos o básico de cada método, o que por si já auxilia em 3R. Ampliar as documentações e ferramentas para englobar mais práticas de 3R, com exemplos trabalhados (que podem ser artigos premiados dos eventos, por exemplo), proveria ótimos recursos para educar os pesquisadores e, principalmente, os futuros pesquisadores (doutorandos, mestrandos e, inclusive, estudantes de Iniciação Científica). | \- Availability of detailed guidelines and checklists; <br> - Integration of 3R in research curricula.                                                |

| P84  | I remember that 10 years ago there was a workshop for replications called RESER, which I guess it does not exist anymore. That was a good incentive, because you knew that you had a place to publish with reviewers that understood the wrok behind replications. Now, I know that EASE and ESEM encourage replications. But try to check the numbers. How many do they even accept? More than practices to increase and improve replications, we need to build a community around it.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | \- Support for replication publications; <br> - Community and venue building for replication.                                                         |

| P88  | A good way to improve replicability/reproduction is to value the time to make this happen in your research career. Funding agencies and research institutions should not strive for \*more\* citations/publications/grants but rather for \*more qualitative\* citations (e.g., real re-use of work rather just mentioning it)/publications (e.g., papers awarded with replication badges)/grants (e.g., projects that made all results replicable through approved methodologies) including the possiblity for replication.                                                                                                                                                                  | \- Cultural change; <br> - Incentives for researchers and reviewers; <br> - Financial and institutional policy change; <br> - Recognition of efforts. |

| P99  | I am very suspicious of financial incentives. This is likely to incentivise the wrong behaviour. The simplest practice is to increase the likelihood that a replication study will be accepted for publication (e.g some conference now have a specific track for such things, which is a good start, but does attach some stigma to being in those tracks - better such studies be supported in main tracks, or perhaps this is a role more journals should adopt).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \- Support for replication publications.                                                                                                              |
