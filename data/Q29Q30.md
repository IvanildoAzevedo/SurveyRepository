## Q29

### [Q29] Use the scale below to indicate how likely you think the following factors would be to improve the Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability of research. 

- Answers: **Very likely;	Likely;	Not very likely;	Not at all likely;	I do not know**.

#### [Q29-A] Professional incentives (e.g., funding or publications) for formally reproducing the work of others.

#### [Q29-B] Financial incentive (e.g., funding or credit towards tenure) for adopting practices that enhance repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability.

#### [Q29-C] More time to teach, and better guidance/supervision, of students, postdocs and other interns for repeatability, reproducibility and replicability of research.

#### [Q29-D] Adopting practices to increase repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability in your own research.

| P42  | I think the more damaging problem is the pressure to publish a lot of paper, that reduces the quality of the papers. I think exiting the "how many articles did you publish?" paradigm to judge researchers to replace it by something like "what is your best published result?" would greatly contribute to a reduced need for pushing papers, thus improving the quality of what's being done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| P74  | Encourage researchers to document and share guidelines of their experiments and experimental packages. Reward researchers that adopt measures to ensure repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability of their research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| P75  | Documentação detalhada e compartilhada de procedimentos comuns para 3R no âmbito de ESE seria um grande facilitador. Por exemplo, o projeto Empirical Standards e ferramentas associadas (https://www2.sigsoft.org/EmpiricalStandards/tools/) permitem, ao menos, verificar se cumprimos o básico de cada método, o que por si já auxilia em 3R. Ampliar as documentações e ferramentas para englobar mais práticas de 3R, com exemplos trabalhados (que podem ser artigos premiados dos eventos, por exemplo), proveria ótimos recursos para educar os pesquisadores e, principalmente, os futuros pesquisadores (doutorandos, mestrandos e, inclusive, estudantes de Iniciação Científica). |
| P76  | Reviewing of replication packages would help. This is a practice not always feasible, due to the need of technical skills in many cases. However, the adoption of tools like Docker, might help and make this reviewing much likely to happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| P84  | I remember that 10 years ago there was a workshop for replications called RESER, which I guess it does not exist anymore. That was a good incentive, because you knew that you had a place to publish with reviewers that understood the wrok behind replications. Now, I know that EASE and ESEM encourage replications. But try to check the numbers. How many do they even accept? More than practices to increase and improve replications, we need to build a community around it.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| P85  | The SE community should work towards a shared infrastructure for replication - such as e.g. is Galaxy for many other scientific disciplines.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| P88  | A good way to improve replicability/reproduction is to value the time to make this happen in your research career. Funding agencies and research institutions should not strive for \*more\* citations/publications/grants but rather for \*more qualitative\* citations (e.g., real re-use of work rather just mentioning it)/publications (e.g., papers awarded with replication badges)/grants (e.g., projects that made all results replicable through approved methodologies) including the possiblity for replication.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| P99  | I am very suspicious of financial incentives. This is likely to incentivise the wrong behaviour. The simplest practice is to increase the likelihood that a replication study will be accepted for publication (e.g some conference now have a specific track for such things, which is a good start, but does attach some stigma to being in those tracks - better such studies be supported in main tracks, or perhaps this is a role more journals should adopt).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
