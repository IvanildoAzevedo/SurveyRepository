## Q29

### [Q29] Use the scale below to indicate how likely you think the following factors would be to improve the Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability of research. 

- Answers: **Very likely;	Likely;	Not very likely;	Not at all likely;	I do not know**.

#### [Q29-A] Professional incentives (e.g., funding or publications) for formally reproducing the work of others.

#### [Q29-B] Financial incentive (e.g., funding or credit towards tenure) for adopting practices that enhance repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability.

#### [Q29-C] More time to teach, and better guidance/supervision, of students, postdocs and other interns for repeatability, reproducibility and replicability of research.

#### [Q29-D] Adopting practices to increase repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability in your own research.
