| P35  | Yes            | Prior caveats notwithstanding, ensuring these things is not entirely something a single research group can achieve, nor is it something that, at this point, can be "guaranteed." But we did explore "joint replication" as a general protocol for uncovering contextual variation. Also the use of bayesian statistics to make quantitative determinations despite low statistical power. Worked well for the instance we used it with respect to design patters.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \- Shares data, tools, and/or replication packages; <br> - Adopts well-established scientific standards and practices.                                                                                                                                                                            |

In industry research which I have been doing since last year, it has been proved to be difficult to share the code and/or data, unless appropreate approvals from regulatory budies has been granted (which usually takes time).                                                                                                                        | \- Shares data, tools, and/or replication packages; <br> - Submits research for internal/external peer review; <br> - Adheres to Open Science practices.                                                                                                                                          |

| P88  | Yes            | Most techniques are implicitly shared in our research group. But usually, we publish all scripts and data (if not permitted by any regulations such as data privacy regulations or licenses) together with the paper on permanently available repositories (e.g., Zenodo). This also encompasses sufficient documentation on installation guide, structure of the replication package, contact information, minimal testing examples, as well as single point to replicate results. Some practices are also enforced by conferences/journal within artifact-evaluation tracks, which award different badges (e.g., ACM). This was another incentive to introduce some practices. | \- Provides detailed documentation; <br> - Shares data, tools, and/or replication packages; <br> - Uses Docker containers or similar technologies.                                                                                                                                                |

| P99  | Yes            | Fundamentally these concepts depend on a clear understanding of what methodology was followed, so we focus on describing methodology clearly and completely, and providing replication packages to help other researchers confirm what we actually did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \- Provides detailed documentation; <br> - Shares data, tools, and/or replication packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
