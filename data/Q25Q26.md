| P12  | Concerning replicability one factor that is completely missing is "lack of generalizability of results" especially when considering "small sample sizes and/or weak effects", results might be perfectly valid internally but do not generalize outside the original sample. This isn't a mistake of the original study or of the peer-review. It is just a quality of empirical research, given a larger more representative sample a given finding might not replicate.                                                                                                                                                     |

See prior free-response answers for more detail.<br><br>(prior free-response: Prior caveats notwithstanding, ensuring these things is not entirely something a single research group can achieve, nor is it something that, at this point, can be "guaranteed." But we did explore "joint replication" as a general protocol for uncovering contextual variation. Also the use of bayesian statistics to make quantitative determinations despite low statistical power. Worked well for the instance we used it with respect to design patters.)                                                     |

| P46  | Some experiment conditions are hard/impossible to reproduce (e.g., an experiment that uses a closed LLM may have used a different non-disclosed version than what is available during the reproduction trials). Also, some reproduction conditions are hard to achieve by a different team that do not have the access to the same type of hardware (e.g., eye tracking, gpu clusters, ...)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| P52  | Confidentiality and inability to share core data. If you for example get 100000 test cases from a company to work with in your research, this is not possible to share. Every. Also, who pays for it? If you are funded by industry projects (which produces some of the most important research in empirical fields!) they will not pay for your to "clean" 100000 test cases so you can share it... the COST and RISK of sharing data is paramount, but never discussed.                                                                                                                                                    |

| P84  | Have you considered that the replication crisis might be due to researchers prioritizing building upon previous studies rather than replicating them? For instance, exploring different aspects or employing alternative methods. Moreover, I'd like to highlight the difficulty in getting replications published. For instance, I faced a reviewer who claimed my replication was solely to increase my number of publications. This lack of recognition for such efforts makes it discouraging considering the significant amount of work involved in replicating.                                                         |

| P87  | Even if code is published, it may be impossible to compile/execute since the material is not self-contained and relies on specific versions of third party applications. Replication packages should contain also all dependencies.<br><br>Scientific code is developed often for a single purpose and hence not well tested or documented. Reuse and reproducing the results is therefore difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| P88  | Keep in mind that some factors limit reproduction/replication of results. Regulations or NDAs may limit open science practice, particularly, for results discussed in industry tracks (which still in SE have very valuable insights). Moreover, making replication packages can be very a tedious work, which is currently not really recognized in the research career (which usually talks about research grants, number of citations/publications). However, there are some directions to measure and value reproduction as well (e.g., R-factor cf. https://doi.org/10.1145/3554976; citing research software artifacts) |

| P99  | I now forget some of what was listed, but the thing I most often encounter when trying to replicate results (or even understand what was done) is missing details about some of the decisions made, both in the methodology description and the replication package. A second issue is that some of the experimental setups are so complex it is difficult to reproduce (e.g. just finding the version of some machine learning setup that was used for a study can be very difficult because it just doesn't exist any longer, or won't install on the particular hardware your lab has).                                    |

| P101 | I think you could make more explicit in the "mistakes" category that one could violate the conditions that should remain the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
