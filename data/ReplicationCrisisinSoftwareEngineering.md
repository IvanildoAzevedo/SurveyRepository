#### [Q17] Have you ever heard about the Replication Crisis as a research problem in the Empirical Software Engineering area?

<br>

#### [Q18] "The Replication Crisis, characterized by continuous difficulty in replicating or reproducing scientific studies, reveals a severe methodological gap in research. Many scientific discoveries have proven difficult or even impossible to replicate, generating a crisis of confidence in the scientific community. This situation highlights the need for a more rigorous and transparent approach to conducting and documenting studies to guarantee the reliability and validity of the results obtained." [1]

#### According to the text explanation, do you believe there is a Replication Crisis in Empirical Software Engineering?
