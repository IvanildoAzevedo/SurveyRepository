| P06  | Agree                      | The statistical treatment of several researches in empirical software engineering is deficient.

| P07  | Strongly Agree             | Depending on the domain, the validity of the experiment can be quite different. It could be a question of how many participants (I saw some papers with 2 participants as opposed to psychology where they have hundreds of people).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Domain-specific challenges limit the applicability of the 3R                                                                                                                              |
| P08  | Strongly Agree             | We have absolutely no idea about the baseline statistics in our field: what variations happen anyway and why, apart from the concept and its empirical data that we study, or the intervention that we wish to evaluate or validate. Without knowing the variations in our noisy data, almost every study makes little sense, and neither does its replication. I'm afraid of many many well-intended studies,repetitions, reproductions, and replications that make little sense without baseline variation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Statistical issues                                                                                                                                                                        |

| P12  | Strongly Agree             | 1) Replications (according to the latest SLR results) are still strongly underrepresented in SE,<br>2) possible problems are not only a lack of replicability/reproducibility of studies but also lacking incentives to replicate the work of other research groups.<br>3) Researchers see this as important but don't want to neither replicate nor even read replications, typically afraid of lack of novelty (See also "Views on Internal and External Validity in Empirical Software Engineering" Siegmund et al. 2015)<br>4) Doing replications is difficult and very different to normal studies (e.g., each deviation from the original study might influence the end result and needs to be recorded and reported)<br>5) it is unclear how a "perfect" replication package should look like, and also how current replication packages look like on average.<br>6) especially reproducibility in human subject experiments is very difficult to achieve given data privacy regulations concerning sharing of raw data. | Lack of incentives; Pressure to publish; Insufficient artifacts or methodological description; Lack of guidelines on the 3R; Domain-specific challenges limit the applicability of the 3R |

| P22  | Strongly Agree             | When we try to create new techniques/procedures and we want to compare ourselves to the state of the art, if we cannot reproduce/replicate their technique/method, we cannot compare ourselves to the state of the art.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Insufficient artifacts or methodological description                                                                                                                                      |

| P25  | Agree                      | The question is about how much liaison (from literal to conceptual) should there be among the original and repeating, reproducing or replicating research. By establishing some ranges, and being consistent with them, SE research could improve these quality attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Lack of guidelines on the 3R                                                                                                                                                              |
| P26  | Neither Agree nor Disagree | Yes, the problem is manifested in the area of empirical software engineering, but the roots of the problem stretch way beyond the matters of ethics and competence from researchers. I believe the current academic system, which places a heavy emphasis on quantity of publications, impact the way researchers adapt to their environment and perform research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Pressure to publish                                                                                                                                                                       |

It is important that the applied method with all the factors/parameters is rigorously described and, when possible, to also make available the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Insufficient artifacts or methodological description                                                                                                                                      |

| P42  | Agree                      | I think this is a problem in every field, so it's also a problem in SE. I think that the main problem in SE is the meaning of "same conditions".

| P46  | Agree                      | Software engineering papers are usually too focused on bringing something new and we barely have any reproductions or replications of previous experiments to make sure their results hold true. It is hard to asses if is a significant problem without this kind of results, but just the lack of this type of experiments seems to be a problem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Limited use of the 3R; Lack of incentives                                                                                                                                                 |
| P47  | Agree                      | This statement has to be related to the type of knowledge searched for.

| P48  | Strongly Agree             | I attempted to replicate a study following the research protocol described in an article. This protocol also included a tool to allow refactoring of UML class diagrams. Although the authors made the tool available, some libraries were missing. I needed to contact the authors to gain access to these libraries. If I did not get any answers, I would not be able to replicate the study. Note that replication in software engineering must also ensure that all platforms (tools and their versions) are also available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Insufficient artifacts or methodological description                                                                                                                                      |

| P52  | Agree                      | However, it is not an easy fix and you CAN NOT put a requirement on it (via e.g. funding agencies) as a lot of empirical work is based on very sensitive data in companies, that can never be shared in any way. E.g. items that can be used to reverse engineer products etc. If we as researchers in empirical areas (e.g. software engineering) do not work with companies due to this our areas are going to become completely irrelevant. It is a trade-off and has to be allowed to be such depending on whom you work with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Domain-specific challenges limit the applicability of the 3R                                                                                                                              |

| P57  | Agree                      | I think ensuring Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability is difficult in any research field, including SE. However, we should also be proud as a community of the major steps ahead we did on these topics in just a few years. Replication packages are nowadays kind of a requirement for publications in top venues, this was not the case only 10 years ago (very few papers had replication packages). Similarly, initiatives such as ACM/IEEE badges, registered reports, conference tracks dedicated to replicated studies are a step in the right direction. Long story short, yes we have a problem but we're at least tackling it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Not as problematic as in other fields                                                                                                                                                     |

| P62  | Strongly Agree             | Most if not all work in the ML for SE area is not replicable, or reproducible. To some extent tools written maybe 5 or so years ago are not even repeatable since environments have changed so much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Technical issues                                                                                                                                                                          |
| P63  | Agree                      | It is the complexity of the conducted studies and experiments and the dependency on so many individual programs or scripts for the analysis which often render the reproduction and replication of a study impossible, at least considering a reasonable effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Technical issues                                                                                                                                                                          |

| P77  | Strongly Agree             | Other disciplines like AI focus on common benchmark basis and comparing improvements against that. While there are in some disciplines (evolving) basics, in most cases research is doing (human/technical) experiments in their own, partially new/not comparable context, intended or not, preventing (joint) boosting efforts - and if there are efforts, they mostly again frequently focus on mainstream topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Domain-specific challenges limit the applicability of the 3R                                                                                                                              |

| P79  | Disagree                   | For me, this is mainly confusion about natural sciences and social sciences -- software engineering is latter one, and we should be following the rules and procedures visible there. In social science, while replicability is valued, it's not that highligted topic that it is in natural sciences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Domain-specific challenges limit the applicability of the 3R                                                                                                                              |

Indeed current trend is actually putting a lot of emphasis on this aspect with conferences making it mandatory for authors to include artifacts that enable reproduction of results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Not as problematic as in other fields                                                                                                                                                     |

| P88  | Strongly Agree             | I strongly agree. As more and more primary studies are published, it becomes more complicated to compare your approach/results to the state-of-the-art. If other results cannot be (sufficiently) replicated, either research is blocked due to trying to get others' results replicated (i.e., another team using the same data/methods) or just using the results as they are reported in the publication, which may harm possible falsifiability. It is getting worse by having more non-deterministic results such as from software artifacts using machine and deep learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Domain-specific challenges limit the applicability of the 3R                                                                                                                              |

| P96  | Strongly Agree             | The human factor makes replication in Software Engineering a great difficulty. It's hard to get people with the exact same background. The different backgrounds can always impact on the results. Also, it takes so long to publish a paper that the technology under study might be outdated by the time the paper becomes available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Domain-specific challenges limit the applicability of the 3R                                                                                                                              |

| P98  | Strongly Agree             | The lack of reproducibility is the biggest of the three problems, as it prevents us from building on top of other research works, leading to wasted effort, poorly applicable insights, and research that is not impactful to society/industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Acknowledges the importance of the 3R                                                                                                                                                     |
| P99  | Agree                      | It's a problem. Is it a significant problem, or a "crisis", it depends on what you consider the expected outcome of research. I think there is reason to be concerned, but I'm not convinced it's a crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Acknowledges the importance of the 3R                                                                                                                                                     |

| P101 | Strongly Agree             | Indeed, the problem was worse and the community has worked to improve it, but it is still a challenge even to reproduce some studies, and most notably to replicate. It slows progress to come across hard to replicate studies even in prestigious venues, because we waste time and doubt the reliability of the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Acknowledges the importance of the 3R                                                                                                                                                     |
