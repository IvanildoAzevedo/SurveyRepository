# Established procedure for data Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability

#### [Q21] Have you (or your research group) established some practice to ensure Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability in your work?

#### [Q22] Tell us about the practices adopted to ensure your work's Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability.

#### [Q23] When were these practices adopted by you (or your research group)?

| P33  | Yes            | Prior caveats notwithstanding, ensuring these things is not entirely something a single research group can achieve, nor is it something that, at this point, can be "guaranteed." But we did explore "joint replication" as a general protocol for uncovering contextual variation. Also the use of bayesian statistics to make quantitative determinations despite low statistical power. Worked well for the instance we used it with respect to design patters.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | In the last 6 years.                                                           |

| P52  | Yes            | We adopted this policy in our academic research group during my PhD. The policy involved inspection of code with other members of the group, and shareing the code and data (where posible, and if it is not, publishing the descriptiv statistics of the data) following open-science practices for every single study. In industry research which I have been doing since last year, it has been proved to be difficult to share the code and/or data, unless appropreate approvals from regulatory budies has been granted (which usually takes time).                                                                                                                        | In the last 6 years.                                                           |
