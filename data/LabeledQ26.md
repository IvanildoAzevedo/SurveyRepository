| P12  | Concerning replicability one factor that is completely missing is "lack of generalizability of results" especially when considering "small sample sizes and/or weak effects", results might be perfectly valid internally but do not generalize outside the original sample. This isn't a mistake of the original study or of the peer-review. It is just a quality of empirical research, given a larger more representative sample a given finding might not replicate.                                                                                                                                                     | \- Insufficient statistical rigor; <br> - Sampling limitations; <br> - Limited generalizability / Context-dependence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| P13  | We are often studying human behavior, which has an element of randomness that can make reproducibility of results impossible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | \- Human subject unpredictability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| P46  | Some experiment conditions are hard/impossible to reproduce (e.g., an experiment that uses a closed LLM may have used a different non-disclosed version than what is available during the reproduction trials). Also, some reproduction conditions are hard to achieve by a different team that do not have the access to the same type of hardware (e.g., eye tracking, gpu clusters, ...)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \- Limited generalizability / Context-dependence; <br> - Dependency and environment issues; <br> - Advanced technologies; <br> - Lack of access to required tools or hardware.                                                                                                                                                                           |

| P84  | Have you considered that the replication crisis might be due to researchers prioritizing building upon previous studies rather than replicating them? For instance, exploring different aspects or employing alternative methods. Moreover, I'd like to highlight the difficulty in getting replications published. For instance, I faced a reviewer who claimed my replication was solely to increase my number of publications. This lack of recognition for such efforts makes it discouraging considering the significant amount of work involved in replicating.                                                         | \- Lack of incentive for replication; <br> - Publication bias and selective reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| P88  | Keep in mind that some factors limit reproduction/replication of results. Regulations or NDAs may limit open science practice, particularly, for results discussed in industry tracks (which still in SE have very valuable insights). Moreover, making replication packages can be very a tedious work, which is currently not really recognized in the research career (which usually talks about research grants, number of citations/publications). However, there are some directions to measure and value reproduction as well (e.g., R-factor cf. https://doi.org/10.1145/3554976; citing research software artifacts) | \- Data unavailability or format issues; <br> - Legal, ethical, or IP restrictions; <br> - Lack of incentive for replication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| P98  | The publishing or perish culture and the lack of openness to publishing negative results are two major factors for fraud/embellishment/selectivity of results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \- Publication bias and selective reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| P99  | I now forget some of what was listed, but the thing I most often encounter when trying to replicate results (or even understand what was done) is missing details about some of the decisions made, both in the methodology description and the replication package. A second issue is that some of the experimental setups are so complex it is difficult to reproduce (e.g. just finding the version of some machine learning setup that was used for a study can be very difficult because it just doesn't exist any longer, or won't install on the particular hardware your lab has).                                    | \- Insufficient statistical rigor; <br> - Lack of transparency in decision-making; <br> - Technological obsolescence; <br> - Dependency and environment issues; <br> - Issues related to research artifacts; <br> - Complexity of experimental setup; <br> - Lack of access to required tools or hardware; <br> - Poor documentation or missing details. |
