| P12  | Yes             | I have done one replication study. It was from an older original paper (from 2015). I had no access to code or data. There were a lot of missing information needed to replicate exactly. We had to contact the original authors multiple times. This helped to a certain extent, but some details were still missing. (Documenting all steps and having at least repeatable code available would have already helped a lot, data would not have been sharable anyway due to data privacy regulations, but would have been optimal.) Also, the study included many machine learning steps. While there is a lot of literature discussing replications in typical controlled experiments (classical statistics, e.g., t-tests, anova, effect-sizes), I found little guidance in what to expect when replication a machine learning task. Replicating an exact participant profile was also challenging, since this meant we had a narrower participant pool to choose from.                                                                                             |

| P28  | Yes             | 1\. Rely on student sample. It is not easy to recruit many partcipants from high-tech company or some organizations, however, we always need participants with ESE or similar backgrounds. People don't have strong motivation to participate in the experiment, especially when they are required to spend 1 or 2 hours on this. In view of this, we are always forced to recruit many students as the subjects, since it is the most economic and convenient way.<br>2\. Student sample is not always enough either. It s not easy to recruit sufficient qualified students. We conducted several experiments in English, however, in my faculty, we don't have enough qualified students who are fluent in English, then we found some students from other countries. We found that the different groups of student performed differently in our experiments, it may caused by culture or the procedure of experiment. This posed threat to validity.                                                                                                               |

| P75  | Yes             | Diversos estudos não disponibilizam o conjunto de dados original (raw dataset), optando por disponibilizar apenas os dados processados e resultados.<br><br>Em outros casos todos os dados estão disponíveis, mas de forma tão desorganizada e sem documentação que inviabiliza a reprodução ou replicação do estudo.<br><br>No caso de conjunto de dados obtidos automaticamente (em estudos de mineração de repositório de software, por exemplo), muitas vezes são disponibilizados os dados, mas não os scripts ou ferramentas utilizados para obter automaticamente os dados originais. Não é raro ver erros nessas ferramentas de extração, ou na forma com que elas são utilizadas, que afetam de forma significativa os dados obtidos e, consequentemente, os resultados. Assim, embora seja possível reproduzir o estudo com os dados originais, ao replicá-lo com outros projetos (por exemplo), sendo necessário obter os dados com as ferramentas citadas, é comum percebermos peculiaridades na obtenção de dados ou erros da extração.                   |
| P76  | Yes             | We study open source software, and in many cases we find that commits from open source repositories disappear, which usually results in non-reproducible results without the original repository including all the commits under study. Therefore, we resorted to include into our replication packages the git repositories containing all the commits we used for our investigation.<br><br>We also faced the problem of past snapshots disappearing from public snapshot repositories (for instance, this is common in the Java landscape), which in turn makes impossible to build commits that depended on those disappeared snapshots. Storing the snapshots in the replication package solves this issue.<br><br>We also face the issue of tooling not working due to different environment conditions. We try to solve this issue by using Docker containers, and including them into our reproduction package. Docker containers contain all the necessary tooling and environment configuration ready for the empirical study to be replicated effortlessly. |

Hard to establish traceability from study hypotheses to obtained results. A recent bad experience was being informed by e-mail about a cherry picked commit for the results of the paper to work. In the category of human factors, personnel turnover is also a issue, which can mitigated a bit if the other issues are properly addressed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
