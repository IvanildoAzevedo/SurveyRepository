New techniques to analyze the uncertainty in experiements is needed to address these problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| P07  | Strongly Agree             | Depending on the domain, the validity of the experiment can be quite different. It could be a question of how many participants (I saw some papers with 2 participants as opposed to psychology where they have hundreds of people).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| P08  | Strongly Agree             | We have absolutely no idea about the baseline statistics in our field: what variations happen anyway and why, apart from the concept and its empirical data that we study, or the intervention that we wish to evaluate or validate. Without knowing the variations in our noisy data, almost every study makes little sense, and neither does its replication. I'm afraid of many many well-intended studies,repetitions, reproductions, and replications that make little sense without baseline variation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| P12  | Strongly Agree             | 1) Replications (according to the latest SLR results) are still strongly underrepresented in SE,<br>2) possible problems are not only a lack of replicability/reproducibility of studies but also lacking incentives to replicate the work of other research groups.<br>3) Researchers see this as important but don't want to neither replicate nor even read replications, typically afraid of lack of novelty (See also "Views on Internal and External Validity in Empirical Software Engineering" Siegmund et al. 2015)<br>4) Doing replications is difficult and very different to normal studies (e.g., each deviation from the original study might influence the end result and needs to be recorded and reported)<br>5) it is unclear how a "perfect" replication package should look like, and also how current replication packages look like on average.<br>6) especially reproducibility in human subject experiments is very difficult to achieve given data privacy regulations concerning sharing of raw data. |
| P13  | Agree                      | Yes, it is a problem in the sense that we could make more progress and have more impact if we had better guidelines for replicability that could be followed by researchers pursuing many different types of empirical studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| P25  | Agree                      | The question is about how much liaison (from literal to conceptual) should there be among the original and repeating, reproducing or replicating research.

| P26  | Neither Agree nor Disagree | Yes, the problem is manifested in the area of empirical software engineering, but the roots of the problem stretch way beyond the matters of ethics and competence from researchers. I believe the current academic system, which places a heavy emphasis on quantity of publications, impact the way researchers adapt to their environment and perform research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| P38  | Agree                      | There's a problem with these three in SE but it's not as bad as in, say, psychology. The main problem in SE is that many researchers still do not share / share enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| P39  | Strongly Agree             | I have tried my self with my colleagues to replicate several studies with no success. It is important that the applied method with all the factors/parameters is rigorously described and, when possible, to also make available the code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| P42  | Agree                      | I think this is a problem in every field, so it's also a problem in SE. I think that the main problem in SE is the meaning of "same conditions". How do you decide when you have a comparable development team, a comparable software system, a comparable feature to implement, ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| P45  | Strongly Agree             | Several contradictions that we find in results of scientific research in SE are related to this point.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| P46  | Agree                      | Software engineering papers are usually too focused on bringing something new and we barely have any reproductions or replications of previous experiments to make sure their results hold true. It is hard to asses if is a significant problem without this kind of results, but just the lack of this type of experiments seems to be a problem                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| P48  | Strongly Agree             | I attempted to replicate a study following the research protocol described in an article. This protocol also included a tool to allow refactoring of UML class diagrams. Although the authors made the tool available, some libraries were missing. I needed to contact the authors to gain access to these libraries. If I did not get any answers, I would not be able to replicate the study. Note that replication in software engineering must also ensure that all platforms (tools and their versions) are also available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| P52  | Agree                      | However, it is not an easy fix and you CAN NOT put a requirement on it (via e.g. funding agencies) as a lot of empirical work is based on very sensitive data in companies, that can never be shared in any way. E.g. items that can be used to reverse engineer products etc. If we as researchers in empirical areas (e.g. software engineering) do not work with companies due to this our areas are going to become completely irrelevant. It is a trade-off and has to be allowed to be such depending on whom you work with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| P57  | Agree                      | I think ensuring Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Replicability is difficult in any research field, including SE. However, we should also be proud as a community of the major steps ahead we did on these topics in just a few years. Replication packages are nowadays kind of a requirement for publications in top venues, this was not the case only 10 years ago (very few papers had replication packages). Similarly, initiatives such as ACM/IEEE badges, registered reports, conference tracks dedicated to replicated studies are a step in the right direction. Long story short, yes we have a problem but we're at least tackling it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| P60  | Neither Agree nor Disagree | If anything, I would guess it's less of a problem in SE.

| P62  | Strongly Agree             | Most if not all work in the ML for SE area is not replicable, or reproducible. To some extent tools written maybe 5 or so years ago are not even repeatable since environments have changed so much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| P63  | Agree                      | It is the complexity of the conducted studies and experiments and the dependency on so many individual programs or scripts for the analysis which often render the reproduction and replication of a study impossible, at least considering a reasonable effort.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Anyway, the current state of the art in computer science makes replications possible and affordable in many contexts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| P74  | Agree                      | I think that repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability are essential to software engineering research. Thus, if it isn't possible to ensure it, it is a significant threat to our studies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| P75  | Agree                      | Embora seja um problema importante, observamos uma boa evoluação em 3R na engenharia de software. Assim, entendo que é um problema que está sendo tratado e resolvido em alguma extensão, tendo muito a melhorar, mas se distanciando de uma crise (como a que encontrávamos até meados de 2000).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| P77  | Strongly Agree             | Other disciplines like AI focus on common benchmark basis and comparing improvements against that. While there are in some disciplines (evolving) basics, in most cases research is doing (human/technical) experiments in their own, partially new/not comparable context, intended or not, preventing (joint) boosting efforts - and if there are efforts, they mostly again frequently focus on mainstream topics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| P79  | Disagree                   | For me, this is mainly confusion about natural sciences and social sciences -- software engineering is latter one, and we should be following the rules and procedures visible there. In social science, while replicability is valued, it's not that highligted topic that it is in natural sciences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Indeed current trend is actually putting a lot of emphasis on this aspect with conferences making it mandatory for authors to include artifacts that enable reproduction of results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| P88  | Strongly Agree             | I strongly agree. As more and more primary studies are published, it becomes more complicated to compare your approach/results to the state-of-the-art. If other results cannot be (sufficiently) replicated, either research is blocked due to trying to get others' results replicated (i.e., another team using the same data/methods) or just using the results as they are reported in the publication, which may harm possible falsifiability. It is getting worse by having more non-deterministic results such as from software artifacts using machine and deep learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| P96  | Strongly Agree             | The human factor makes replication in Software Engineering a great difficulty. It's hard to get people with the exact same background. The different backgrounds can always impact on the results. Also, it takes so long to publish a paper that the technology under study might be outdated by the time the paper becomes available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| P98  | Strongly Agree             | The lack of reproducibility is the biggest of the three problems, as it prevents us from building on top of other research works, leading to wasted effort, poorly applicable insights, and research that is not impactful to society/industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| P99  | Agree                      | It's a problem. Is it a significant problem, or a "crisis", it depends on what you consider the expected outcome of research. I think there is reason to be concerned, but I'm not convinced it's a crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| P101 | Strongly Agree             | Indeed, the problem was worse and the community has worked to improve it, but it is still a challenge even to reproduce some studies, and most notably to replicate. It slows progress to come across hard to replicate studies even in prestigious venues, because we waste time and doubt the reliability of the results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
