- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) (optional, but recommended).


### ⏱ System Requirements

No specific hardware requirements are needed to execute the scripts.


### 🛠 Steps to Run

1. Download and install **R**.
2. Download and install **RStudio**.
3. Download an R script from the [scripts folder](data/scripts/scripts.md).
4. Open an R script.
  - Open one script at a time.
6. Run the script using:
  - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + Enter`
  - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`
5. Open the output image file generated by R.
  - It will be saved in the same folder as the script, using the same filename.

> 💡 Each script generates one plot used in the [paper](Paper.pdf).
